# HelloList

A quick tool for merging HelloFresh recipes' ingredient lists into a single shopping list.

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://www.github.com/neuroneuro15/hellolist
```

## Usage

Just type **hellolist** into the command line, and a file dialog will pop up.  Select all html files containing downloaded HelloFresh recipes, and it will save the ingredient list in an excel file.

## Note

This was a fun evening project for a couple doing cooking and programming together.  If you'd like to suggest improvements (like more flexible usage, a nice output, a better command line tool, web scraping, or a web interface), please put it on the issue list--we'll be happy that someone else was interested in this project!
